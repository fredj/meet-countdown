# Goal: create a Google Meet extension to track time left

The only way to add features to Google Meet is by using a Chrome extension or Tampermonkey.
Unlike the old Google Hangouts, Google Meet doesn't offer an API.

It's local to a user and not shared between participants.

To be compatible with firefox, I will create a userscript with Tampermonkey.

First step: create a descent timer countdown (as a web component using lit)


Installation:
 * install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)



The extension I've created 

Display a countdown

Start the timer
